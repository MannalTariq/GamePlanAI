 # GamePlan AI – Optimizing Football Set-Piece Strategies

## Overview

GamePlan AI is an AI-driven football analytics platform focused on analyzing and optimizing **set-piece scenarios**, specifically **corner kicks and free kicks**. The system leverages **deep learning**, **spatio-temporal data**, and **predictive analytics** to provide data-driven tactical recommendations and success probabilities, enabling coaches to make informed decisions in real time.

## Objectives

* Analyze player positioning and movements during set-pieces
* Predict success probabilities for different tactical setups
* Recommend optimal player positioning using AI models
* Simulate set-piece strategies through an interactive interface
* Provide scalable decision-support for amateur and professional teams

## Key Features

* **Set-Piece Focus:** Dedicated analysis for corner kicks and free kicks
* **Predictive Modeling:** Deep learning–based models trained on football event data
* **Generative Strategy Simulation:** Simulates multiple tactical configurations
* **Success Probability Estimation:** Quantifies likelihood of success per strategy
* **Interactive Frontend:** Real-time visualization of tactics and simulations

## Datasets & Research

**Datasets Used:**

* Wyscout Soccer Match Event Dataset
* StatsBomb Open Data
* Football Events Dataset (Kaggle)

**Research Reference:**

* *TacticAI: An AI Assistant for Football Tactics* (Nature Communications)

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular, multi-layer architecture:

* **Data Layer:** Player and event data storage, preprocessing, and validation
* **Analytics Layer:** EDA, predictive and generative deep learning models
* **Simulation Layer:** Strategy simulation and probability estimation
* **Presentation Layer:** Web-based frontend for visualization and interaction

## Project Modules

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Cleaning, standardization, and preparation of football event data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Pattern analysis, bias detection, and feature insights
3. **Predictive Modeling** – Deep learning models to predict set-piece success outcomes
4. **Generative Modeling & Simulation** – Tactical scenario generation and simulation
5. **Frontend Visualization** – Interactive UI for real-time tactical analysis

## Current Progress

* Predictive models trained for **corner kicks** and **free kicks**
* Model visualizations and probability outputs implemented
* Frontend developed with tactical views and simulation screens
* Initial performance targets achieved for corner kick prediction

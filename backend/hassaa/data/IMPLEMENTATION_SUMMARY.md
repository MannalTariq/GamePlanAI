# GNN Implementation for Set-Piece Analysis - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete Graph Neural Network solution using GATv2 to evaluate whether GNNs improve upon current tabular baselines for:
1. Shot prediction (graph-level classification)
2. Receiver prediction (node-level ranking/classification)

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Model Architectures (`models/gatv2_models.py`)

**MultiTaskGATv2**: Shared encoder with two task-specific heads
- GATv2Encoder with residual connections and LayerNorm
- ShotHead with global attention pooling
- ReceiverHead with node-level MLP

**SingleTask Models**: Separate models for each task
- SingleTaskGATv2Shot: Dedicated shot prediction model
- SingleTaskGATv2Receiver: Dedicated receiver prediction model

### 2. Advanced Graph Dataset (`gnn_dataset.py`)

**Enhanced Node Features**:
- Player position (x,y) normalized to [0,1]
- Velocity components (vx, vy)
- Team roles (is_attacker, is_goalkeeper)
- Distances (to ball, to goal) normalized
- Role encoding, physical attributes (height, header ability)
- Skill embeddings (pace, jumping, heading)
- Temporal context (minute bucket)
- Missing value flags for imputed features

**Enhanced Edge Features**:
- Euclidean distance between players
- Relative angle to goal
- Team relationship (same team flag)
- Marking assignment flags

**Graph Construction**:
- Radius-based connections (R=15m default)
- Player-to-ball connections
- K-nearest neighbors for connectivity (k=4)
- One graph per set-piece event

### 3. Comprehensive Training Pipeline (`gnn_train.py`)

**Loss Functions**:
- Shot prediction: BCEWithLogitsLoss with positive weighting
- Receiver prediction: Combination of pairwise ranking loss and BCE

**Training Features**:
- Multi-task and single-task training variants
- Class weighting for imbalanced data
- Gradient clipping for stability
- Learning rate scheduling
- Early stopping based on validation metrics

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Shot: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
- Receiver: Top-k accuracy, MAP, NDCG
- Calibration assessment with temperature scaling

### 4. Experimentation Framework (`run_experiments.py`)

**Hyperparameter Search**:
- Grid search over key parameters
- Configurable search spaces
- Automated model comparison

**Model Training**:
- Cross-validation with GroupKFold (by match_id)
- Comprehensive evaluation reporting
- Checkpoint saving for best models

### 5. Reporting and Analysis (`generate_final_report.py`)

**Model Comparison**:
- Side-by-side performance metrics
- Visualization of results
- Statistical significance testing
- Detailed recommendation reports

## Key Improvements Over Baseline

### 1. Feature Engineering
- More comprehensive player attributes
- Explicit handling of missing values
- Enhanced spatial relationships
- Better temporal context

### 2. Model Architecture
- GATv2 for edge attention
- Residual connections for deeper networks
- Multi-head attention for representation diversity
- Layer normalization for training stability

### 3. Training Methodology
- Ranking loss for receiver prediction
- Class weighting for imbalanced data
- Temperature scaling for calibration
- Proper cross-validation to prevent leakage

### 4. Evaluation Framework
- Multiple metrics for both tasks
- Calibration assessment
- Cross-validation with proper grouping
- Detailed model comparison

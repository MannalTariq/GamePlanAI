## 📦 Components

### 1. **`strategy_maker.py`** - Core Strategy Generation

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Loads best performing model checkpoint (`best_gnn_shot_fold*.pt`)
- ✅ Converts player placements → PyG graph structure
- ✅ Runs GNN inference for receiver + shot predictions
- ✅ Ranks attackers by predicted receiver probability
- ✅ Generates tactical decision logic
- ✅ Creates simulation data for visualization
- ✅ Saves strategy to timestamped JSON files

**Main Class:** `StrategyMaker`

**Methods:**
```python
# Initialize with trained models
strategy_maker = StrategyMaker(model_dir="path/to/models", device="cpu")

# Generate strategy from player positions
strategy = strategy_maker.predict_strategy(players, corner_position=(105, 0))

# Save strategy for future fine-tuning
filepath = strategy_maker.save_strategy(strategy)

# Generate simulation data
sim_data = strategy_maker.generate_simulation_data(strategy)
```

### 2. **`interactive_tactical_setup.py`** - Enhanced UI Integration

**New Capabilities:**
- ✅ Integrated `StrategyMaker` initialization
- ✅ Real-time GNN predictions on "Done" button
- ✅ Visual highlighting of predicted receiver
- ✅ Shot trajectory visualization
- ✅ Strategy summary overlay
- ✅ Automatic JSON export

**Usage Flow:**
1. Place players on pitch (attackers, defenders, goalkeeper)
2. Click "Done" button
3. System runs GNN inference automatically
4. Visualizes predicted strategy in same window
5. Saves strategy to `generated_strategy_<timestamp>.json`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Test Strategy Maker Standalone

```bash
cd data
python test_strategy_maker.py
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Model loading confirmation
- ✅ Strategy predictions with scores
- ✅ Saved JSON file location
- ✅ Integration test results

---

### Option 2: Interactive Tactical Setup

```bash
cd data
python interactive_tactical_setup.py
```

**Steps:**
1. **Place Players**: Click to place attackers, defenders, goalkeeper
2. **Click "Done"**: Triggers GNN strategy generation
3. **View Predictions**:
   - Highlighted receiver (yellow circle)
   - Shot trajectory (red dotted line)
   - Strategy summary (top-left)
   - Confidence scores

---

## 📊 Model Integration

### Model Files Required

The system automatically searches for trained checkpoints in priority order:

**Shot Prediction:**
1. `best_gnn_shot_fold*.pt` (preferred)
2. `best_gnn_multitask_fold*.pt` (fallback)

**Receiver Prediction:**
1. `best_gnn_receiver_fold*.pt` (preferred)
2. `best_gnn_multitask_fold*.pt` (fallback)

### Model Architecture Match

```python
# Shot Model: SingleTaskGATv2Shot
checkpoint = {
    "in_dim": 21,        # 21 node features
    "hidden": 128,       # Hidden dimension
    "heads": 4,          # Attention heads
    "dropout": 0.2,      # Dropout rate
    "model_state": {...} # Trained weights
}

# Receiver Model: SingleTaskGATv2Receiver
# Same structure, different task head
```

---

## 📋 Strategy Output Format

### JSON Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T20:30:45.123456",
  "corner_position": [105, 0],
  "num_players": 11,
  "predictions": {
    "primary_receiver": {
      "player_id": 100002,
      "score": 0.876,
      "position": {"id": 100002, "x": 92, "y": 34, "team": "attacker"}
    },
    "alternate_receivers": [
      {"player_id": 100001, "score": 0.723, "position": {...}},
      {"player_id": 100003, "score": 0.654, "position": {...}}
    ],
    "shot_confidence": 0.782,
    "tactical_decision": "Direct shot on first touch"
  },
  "player_placements": [...]
}
```

---

## 🎮 Tactical Decision Logic

### Decision Thresholds

```python
if shot_confidence > 0.6:
    tactical_decision = "Direct shot on first touch"
else:
    tactical_decision = "Layoff to create better angle"
```

### Receiver Ranking

- **Top-1 Receiver**: Highest predicted probability
- **Alternates (Top-2 to Top-4)**: Backup options
- **Confidence Score**: Sigmoid probability (0.0 - 1.0)

---

## 🎥 Visualization Features

### Real-Time Simulation Elements

1. **Predicted Receiver Highlight**
   - Yellow dashed circle (radius 2.5m)
   - Label showing confidence percentage
   
2. **Ball Trajectory**
   - White solid line from corner to receiver
   - Bezier curve for realistic arc
   
3. **Shot Path** (if confidence > 60%)
   - Red dotted line from receiver to goal
   - "SHOOT!" label at midpoint
   
4. **Strategy Summary Overlay**
   - Top-left corner
   - Shows: Receiver ID, confidence, shot %, tactical decision

## 🔄 Future Fine-Tuning Workflow

### Strategy Data Collection

All generated strategies are saved with timestamps:
```
generated_strategy_20251011_203045.json
generated_strategy_20251011_203312.json
...
```

### Fine-Tuning Pipeline (Future)

```python
# 1. Collect strategy outputs
strategy_files = glob.glob("generated_strategy_*.json")

# 2. Label actual outcomes
#    - Did the receiver prediction succeed?
#    - Was the shot taken? Did it score?

# 3. Create fine-tuning dataset
#    - Positive examples: Correct predictions
#    - Negative examples: Incorrect predictions

# 4. Fine-tune model with new data
#    - Use saved strategies as additional training samples
#    - Improve model accuracy iteratively
```

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: No Model Checkpoints Found**
```
Solution: Run training first with:
python gnn_train.py
```

**Issue 2: Import Errors**
```python
# Ensure modules are in Python path
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
```

**Issue 3: GPU/CPU Device Mismatch**
```python
# Force CPU mode
strategy_maker = StrategyMaker(device="cpu")
```

# Goal Direction Fix - Corner Side Selection

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue**: When selecting a **left corner** (x=0), players were moving toward the **right goal** (x=105) instead of the **left goal** (x=0). This caused players to run **away from the goal** they should be attacking.

**Root Cause**: The goal position was hardcoded to `(105, 34)` throughout the codebase, regardless of which corner was selected.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Goal Position Variable**
Added `self.goal_position` to track which goal to attack based on corner selection:

```python
# In __init__
self.goal_position = (105, 34)  # Dynamic goal position based on corner side
```

### 2. **Corner Selection Updates Goal Position**

Updated corner button handlers to set the correct goal:

```python
def _on_corner_left(self, event):
    # ... corner position logic ...
    self.goal_position = (0, 34)  # Attack left goal
    
def _on_corner_right(self, event):
    # ... corner position logic ...
    self.goal_position = (105, 34)  # Attack right goal
```

### 3. **Updated All Movement Calculations**

#### Primary Receiver Movement
```python
def calculate_tactical_target(self, player, primary_receiver_id, strategy):
    if player['id'] == primary_receiver_id:
        goal_x, goal_y = self.goal_position  # Use dynamic goal
        dx = (goal_x - x) * 0.3
        dy = (goal_y - y) * 0.2
        
        # Adapt bounds based on goal side
        if goal_x > 50:  # Right goal
            return (min(102, x + dx), ...)
        else:  # Left goal
            return (max(3, x + dx), ...)
```

#### Support Runner Movement
```python
def calculate_support_run_position(self, player, primary_receiver_id):
    # Direction based on goal side
    if self.goal_position[0] > 50:  # Right goal
        target_x = min(100, x + dx_norm * 0.5 + 2)  # Move right
    else:  # Left goal
        target_x = max(5, x + dx_norm * 0.5 - 2)  # Move left
```

#### Defender Positioning
```python
def calculate_defensive_target(self, defender):
    # Defensive zones adapt to goal side
    if self.goal_position[0] > 50:  # Defending right goal
        target_x = max(70, min(100, target_x))
    else:  # Defending left goal
        target_x = max(5, min(35, target_x))
```

#### Goalkeeper Positioning
```python
def calculate_keeper_target(self, keeper, strategy):
    if self.goal_position[0] > 50:  # Right goal
        if shot_confidence > 0.6:
            target_x = 103.5
    else:  # Left goal
        if shot_confidence > 0.6:
            target_x = 1.5
```

### 4. **Updated Animation Targets**

```python
# Shot animation now uses dynamic goal
goal_target = self.goal_position  # Instead of (105, 34)

# Goal text position adapts to goal side
goal_text_x = self.goal_position[0]
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

```
✅ ALL GOAL DIRECTION TESTS PASSED!

📊 TEST RESULTS:
   ✅ Right corners (x=105) → attack right goal (105, 34)
   ✅ Left corners (x=0) → attack left goal (0, 34)
   ✅ Players move toward correct goal based on corner side
   ✅ Support runners adapt direction to goal position
   ✅ Defenders position correctly for their goal
   ✅ Goalkeeper moves to correct goal position
   ✅ Shot animations target correct goal
```

### Test Examples

**Right Corner (Default)**:
- Corner: (105, 0)
- Goal: (105, 34)
- Player at (90, 34) → Moves to (94.5, 34) ✅ (moving right toward goal)

**Left Corner**:
- Corner: (0, 0)
- Goal: (0, 34)
- Player at (15, 34) → Moves to (10.5, 34) ✅ (moving left toward goal)

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Buggy Behavior)
```
Left Corner (0, 0)
├─ Ball starts at (0, 0) ✓
├─ Goal position: (105, 34) ✗ WRONG!
└─ Players move RIGHT (away from left goal) ✗ BUG!
```

### After (Fixed Behavior)
```
Left Corner (0, 0)
├─ Ball starts at (0, 0) ✓
├─ Goal position: (0, 34) ✓ CORRECT!
└─ Players move LEFT (toward left goal) ✓ FIXED!
```

## 🎯 Corner-Goal Mapping

| Corner Position | Goal Position | Attack Direction |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Bottom-Right (105, 0) | (105, 34) | Attacking right goal |
| Top-Right (105, 68) | (105, 34) | Attacking right goal |
| Bottom-Left (0, 0) | **(0, 34)** | **Attacking left goal** |
| Top-Left (0, 68) | **(0, 34)** | **Attacking left goal** |

## 📁 Files Modified

### `interactive_tactical_setup.py`

## 🎉 Summary

The fix ensures that:
1. **Left corners attack the left goal** (x=0)
2. **Right corners attack the right goal** (x=105)
3. **All player movements** adapt to the correct goal direction
4. **Support runners** move in the correct direction
5. **Defenders** position correctly relative to their goal
6. **Goalkeeper** moves to the correct goal position
7. **Shot animations** target the correct goal

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND TESTED**  
**Impact**: Players now correctly move toward the goal they're attacking, regardless of corner side selection.

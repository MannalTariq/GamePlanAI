## üõ†Ô∏è **Major Enhancements Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced Tactical Context Weighting System** 
- **File**: `strategy_maker.py`
- **Features Added**:
  - **Unmarked Player Detection**: Finds closest defender, gives +0.20 bonus if >8m away
  - **Distance to Goal Bonus**: Up to +0.15 bonus for players closer to goal
  - **Tactical Position Bonus**: +0.12 bonus for penalty area, +0.06 for extended scoring area
  - **Header Opportunity Bonus**: +0.08 for central positions, +0.06 for optimal distance (8-18m)
  - **Goal Proximity Bonus**: Enhanced proximity calculation with penalty area bonus

```python
# Example: Player gets multiple bonuses
total_bonus = distance_bonus + unmarked_bonus + goal_proximity_bonus + tactical_bonus + header_bonus
adjusted_score = base_gnn_score + total_bonus
```

### 2. **Dynamic Player State Tracking System**

  - **Movement Trails**: Visual indicators showing player movements
  - **Speed Differentiation**: Attackers (0.8), Defenders (0.6), Keepers (0.4)
  - **Tactical Arrows**: Color-coded movement arrows showing intent

### 4. **Enhanced Shot Trajectory Visualization**
- **Curved Shot Paths**: Realistic ball trajectory with physics-based curves

## üìä **Technical Implementation Details**

### Tactical Context Weighting Algorithm
```python
def _apply_tactical_context_weighting(self, player_id, player, base_score, all_players, corner_position):
    # 1. Distance to goal (0-0.15 bonus)
    distance_bonus = max(0, (30.0 - dist_to_goal) / 30.0) * 0.15
    
    # 2. Unmarked detection (0.20 bonus if unmarked)
    is_unmarked, closest_def = self._check_if_unmarked(player, all_players)
    unmarked_bonus = 0.20 if is_unmarked and closest_def > 8.0 else 0.0
    
    # 3. Tactical positioning (up to 0.30 bonus)
    tactical_bonus = angle_bonus + central_bonus + scoring_zone_bonus
    
    # 4. Header opportunities (up to 0.14 bonus)
    header_bonus = central_header_bonus + distance_header_bonus
    
    # 5. Goal proximity (up to 0.30 bonus)
    goal_proximity_bonus = proximity * 0.15 + penalty_area_bonus
    
    return base_score + sum(all_bonuses)
```

### Player Movement System
```python
def calculate_tactical_target(self, player, primary_receiver_id, strategy):
    if player['id'] == primary_receiver_id:
        # Move toward goal for shot
        return move_toward_shooting_position()
    elif player['team'] == 'defender':
        # Mark nearest attacker
        return mark_nearest_threat()
    elif player['team'] == 'attacker':
        # Create space and support
        return create_space_and_support()
```

## üìù **Key Technical Insights**

### 1. **Tactical Context Stacking**
Multiple bonus systems work together, not in isolation. A player can receive:
- Distance bonus (+0.15 max)
- Unmarked bonus (+0.20 if detected)  
- Tactical position (+0.30 max)
- Header opportunity (+0.14 max)
- Goal proximity (+0.30 max)

### 2. **Dynamic vs Static Selection**
The system now considers **context** alongside **GNN capability**:
```
Final Score = GNN Base Score + Tactical Context Bonuses
```

### 3. **Real-Time Responsiveness**
Graph rebuilding ensures the GNN sees current positions:
```
üîÑ REBUILDING GRAPH FROM CURRENT POSITIONS...
‚úÖ Graph rebuilt successfully with N players
```

### 4. **Animation Realism**
Player movements are role-specific and physics-aware:
- Attackers create space and support runs
- Defenders track and mark threats  
- Goalkeepers adjust based on danger level

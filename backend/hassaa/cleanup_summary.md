# Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup process performed on the GNN-based set-piece analysis project. The goal was to remove unnecessary files and keep only the essential components required for the core functionality.

## Files Kept

### Core Model Files
- `models/gatv2_models.py` - Main GATv2 model architectures
- `model.py` - Original TacticalAI model

### Core Data Processing Files
- `gnn_dataset.py` - Graph dataset construction
- `preprocessing.py` - Data preprocessing pipeline
- `gnn_train.py` - Training and evaluation pipeline

### Execution Files
- `run_experiments.py` - Hyperparameter search and training
- `train.py` - Training pipeline
- `run_training.py` - Training execution
- `test_gnn_implementation.py` - Unit tests
- `validate_implementation.py` - Implementation validation
- `run_complete_pipeline.py` - Complete pipeline execution
- `generate_final_report.py` - Model comparison and reporting

### Documentation Files
- `GNN_README.md` - Detailed GNN documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
- `README.md` - Main README

### Configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

### Visualization Files
- `corner_replay_v4.py` - Most advanced visualization
- `strategy_suggester.py` - Strategy suggestion system

### Essential Data Files
- `preprocessed_data.pkl` - Preprocessed data
- `sample_graph.json` - Sample graph data
- `demo_sample_graph.json` - Demo sample graph data

## Files Deleted
Over 150 unnecessary files were removed, including:
- Duplicate model implementations
- Multiple versions of visualization scripts
- Test files for deprecated components
- Report files from previous experiments
- Documentation for outdated features
- Temporary and cache files
- Model checkpoint files
- Various utility scripts that are no longer needed

## Directories Removed
- `plots/` - All generated plots
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache directories
- `models/__pycache__/` - Model cache directory

## Backup
All essential files were backed up to `c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\hassaa\backup\` before deletion.

## Validation
The core functionality was validated successfully with the `validate_implementation.py` script, confirming that all essential components are still working correctly.

## Conclusion
The project has been successfully cleaned up, reducing clutter while maintaining all core functionality. The remaining files represent a streamlined, focused implementation of the GNN-based set-piece analysis system.
